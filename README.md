## Team-16 Romit Gupta and Kadam Patel

We are desinging an application that solves the problem with most health apps have that they're either too technical or not technical enough. Our intention is to create a technically sound and easy-to-use application so that children under 18 and seniors do not get bogged down. The solution proposed by the team is a drug tracking application. This application focuses on medication reminders and various features. These features include medication reminders (with alarms), UI/UX simple and user-friendly.
